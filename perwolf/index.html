                    <i>The developments in typeface design, typesetting and printing have always been aimed at the improvement of “quality”. Compared to printing techniques as they existed in the early 15th century we have indeed come a long way. We can digitally output the most perfectly drawn typefaces onto film in resolutions of up to 5000 lines per inch. We can print in offset, in perfect registration, on the smoothest papers and finish it off with layers of varnish, all at a speed that our 15th century forefathers would find baffling. Technically we can create the slickest printing ever, reach the highest possible quality ever. Unfortunately, the results have too often become absolutely boring. The quality of a printed product, the high resolution of its typefaces, the perfect printing are not necessarily what makes for good design or clear communication. [...] Type has always been in flux. [...] Random technology, which is what we call the programming that is involved, is about letting the rasterizer behave randomly within the boundaries of legibility. Instead of recreating a fixed outline or bitmap, the Randomfont redefines its outlines every time they are called for. Thus, each character will be different each time it is printed.</i>

                     - Is Best Really Better (About RandomFonts and code), Erik van Blokland, Just van Rossum, published Emigré 18, 1990.
                    <br><br>
                    Inspired by <b>Erik van Blokland</b> and <b>Just van Rossum</b>’s playful philosophy during the process of creating the first RandomFont typeface, <b>Beowolf</b>, in 1990, the web-based type randomization tool Perwolf was created. Unlike Beowolf, the tool applies a particular noise texture—<b>Perlin noise</b> (created by <b>Ken Perlin</b> in 1983)—to the outlines of the characters in the input text written in any imported OpenType Font (consequently "converting" it to an outline font in the process) based on the user-defined parameters (intensity and scale of the noise texture) and generates a downloadable Scalable Vector Graphics graphic. Depending on the defined parameters, the output can vary from slightly distorted but still readable letters to heavily abstracted expressionistic forms. Just as with Beowolf, the outlines of a particular letter will never be the same twice and are therefore completely unique in every iteration.
                    <br><br>
                    By default, the display font is Fanwood Regular (by Barry Schwartz), used due to its relative resemblance to Beowolf without the randomization—although admittedly a much more modern and way less Gothic typeface. The transformation is achieved using the JavaScript libraries p5.js (created by Lauren McCarthy), opentype.min.js (by Frederik De Bleser), and p5.svg.min.js (by Zeno Zeng).

                    Created by <b>Matija Resman</b> with the guidance of <b>Prof. Pierre Pané-Farré</b> and <b>Simon Thiefes</b> as a semester project for the Co-Op Monday course at <b>HAW Hamburg</b> in <b>2024</b>.
